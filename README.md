# CaptionAI
A deep learning–based image captioning system that generates natural-language descriptions for input images.

## 📌 Overview
CaptionAI is a Python project that uses a CNN encoder and a LSTM decoder to produce captions for images. It demonstrates end-to-end image captioning, from feature extraction to natural language generation.

## ✨ Features
- Generate captions for uploaded images
- Uses pre-trained encoder–decoder architecture
- Clean and interactive Streamlit-based UI
- Easy to extend and fine-tune

## 🧠 Tech Stack
- Python 3.x
- PyTorch / TensorFlow (depending on your implementation)
- CNN encoder (e.g., ResNet, Inception)
- RNN/Transformer decoder
- Streamlit for deployment
- Jupyter Notebook for experimentation

## 📥 Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/manvip28/Img_Caption.git
cd Img_Caption
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## ▶️ Usage
1. Open the notebook or Python script.
2. Load an image (JPG/PNG).
3. Run the caption generator to produce descriptions.
4. Optionally, deploy using Streamlit.

Example (local run):
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

## 🎯 Why This Project
This project bridges computer vision and natural language processing by creating a system that can “understand” images and “describe” them in human language. Great for learning, demos, and research use.
